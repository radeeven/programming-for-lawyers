In this part, we will look at how to read data directly from web APIs.
Web APIs are <em>machine-readable</em> online data sources.
We will look at two different web APIs.</p>
<div class="admonition-echr-od-api admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">ECHR-OD API</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://echr-opendata.eu/">European Court of Human Rights Open Data</a> (ECHR-OD) project provides data about ECHR cases.
ECHR-OD provides <a class="reference external" href="https://echr-opendata.eu/download/">machine-readable data for download</a>,
but also a public <a class="reference external" href="https://echr-opendata.eu/connect/">ECHR-OD API</a> for online use.

<div class="admonition-harvards-caselaw-access-project admonition">

machine-readable format.
CAP and the data format is <a class="reference external" href="https://case.law/api/">documented here</a>.</p>

<h2>Reading JSON from file<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-json-from-file" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<div class="admonition-json admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">JSON</p>
<p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a machine-readable data format.
Machine-readable data makes it easy to read and process the information with a computer.
JSON data is usually tree structured, with multiple levels containing information.</p>
<p>In Python, JSON data is stored as lists and dictionaries.
The top level can be either a list or a dictionary.</p>
</div>
<p>First, let’s look at how we can read JSON data from a local file.
Here we read a file containing a few cases from ECHR-OD.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">json</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">read_json_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;r&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="p">:</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">json</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">loads</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text_data</span><span class="p">)</span>
    
<span class="n">cases</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">read_json_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;cases-5.json&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, this approach has some drawbacks.
Firstly, we must manually download the data set.
Secondly, we must keep the data set updated.
Case law databases are updated regularly, and we probably want to include the latest data.
Therefore, using online data directly is sometimes preferable.
For example, if we are developing a mobile app, the full data set might be too large to fit on the device.</p>

<section id="reading-json-from-a-web-api">
<h2>Reading JSON from a web API<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-json-from-a-web-api" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>To fetch data from the web, we can use a library called requests that makes this task quite easy.
First, we import this:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">requests</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, we will look at the ECHR-OD API.
This API has a function of getting statistics about the number of cases.
We need to specify the URL:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://echr-opendata.eu/api/v1/stats&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

We use the request library’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.get()</span></code> function to fetch the data,

Secondly, the decision at issue had become final by 16 November 1987, and its enforcement had been ordered on 18 May 1990. Thirdly, Protocol No. 1 had entered into force in respect of  on 3 March 2004, meaning that the non-enforcement at issue has been within the Court&#39;s competence ratione temporis for a period of five years and eight months, some fourteen years having already elapsed before that date.

It cannot be presumed that in such proceedings the Bulgarian courts would have refused to entertain arguments based on freedom of expression, or that a claim founded on such arguments would have been destined to fail (ibid.). It is true that in the minor hooliganism proceedings against the applicant the Blagoevgrad District Court and the Blagoevgrad Regional Court came to the view that it was proper to find him guilty and fine him even though he had sought to exercise his right to freedom of expression (see paragraphs 15-17 and 19 above). But that does not necessarily imply that the Blagoevgrad Administrative Court and the Supreme Administrative Court – the courts competent at the time to deal at first instance and on appeal with legal challenges against police detention – would have seen the matter in the same light and decided that it had been lawful and justified to detain the applicant. He did not therefore exhaust domestic remedies with respect to his grievance – assuming he raised one – that his police detention was in breach of his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.&#39;,

The nearest notion to which that provision referred was “the prevention of disorder or crime”, but there was a perceptible difference between the two. His harmless prank had not been capable of causing “disorder of crime” even if it had upset some people. Nor was it clear how precisely it had affected the “rights of others”.&#39;,

It was puzzling to him that thirty years after the fall of the communist regime the authorities still conflated those notions, and perceived political protest as hooliganism without inquiring into its goals or symbolism. They had disregarded the applicant’s motives and had seen his innocuous gesture as vandalism even though it had not damaged the monument in any way. It had to be emphasised in that connection that his act had been a form of protest against a government which had lost its legitimacy and which had shortly after that resigned. Indeed, the courts had acknowledged that fact, and had noted that the applicant was a local politician. It could hardly be said that the proceedings against him had somehow increased his popularity. Only the first-instance court had tried to carry out some sort of balancing exercise, whereas the appellate court had brushed aside the arguments based on his right to freedom of expression.&#39;,

They were, however, of the view that that interference had met the requirements of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention. The legal basis for the interference – the 1963 Decree – was sufficiently accessible and precise, and the case-law of the Bulgarian courts under it was abundant and settled. The interference had sought to protect public safety and the rights of others; that was evident from the terms of Article 1 § 2 of the 1963 Decree, under which the applicant had been sanctioned, and from the reasons given by the Bulgarian courts in his case.&#39;,

         {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;44.\xa0\xa0The interference had also been necessary and proportionate. The applicant’s sanction had been administrative rather than criminal, and a very mild one – the minimum possible fine under the 1963 Decree, which had equalled less than a third of the minimum monthly salary in Bulgaria at the time. The applicant had been found guilty for desecrating a monument rather than for offending Mr Blagoev’s memory or for voicing his political views. It was true that political expression enjoyed heightened protection, but it could be interfered with if the means used for it disturbed public order or the everyday functioning of society. It was clear that the applicant had prepared his act in advance, and that he had sought to attract media attention to it. Apart from its artistic and historical value, Mr Blagoev’s monument was also a symbol of the eponymous town. Vandalism against monuments was amenable to sanctions in all Contracting States. The link between the monument and the government in power was neither evident nor perceived by the public as direct. At the time the applicant had not been a well-known politician. Indeed, it had been that very act and the subsequent proceedings against him that had made him popular and had propelled him into being elected as a municipal councillor. When finding him guilty, the courts had carefully weighed up all circumstances, with due regard for his right to freedom of expression, and had spelled out in detail the justification for interfering with that right. There was no evidence that the fine given to the applicant had caused him any hardship.&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;49.\xa0\xa0The sanction imposed on the applicant was the mildest possible under the legal provision that he was found to have breached (see paragraphs 17 and 23 above). It was indeed quite lenient, consisting solely of an administrative fine of BGN 100 (equivalent to EUR 51), which the applicant was able to pay almost immediately and apparently without any difficulty (see paragraphs 15 and 20 above). It was, moreover, not entered in the applicant’s criminal record (see paragraph 25 above). If his conviction is considered justified, that sanction cannot hence be seen as disproportionate in itself (contrast Murat Vural, §§ 66-68; Shvydka, § 41; and Mătăsaru, §§\xa035-36, all cited above). The salient question thus becomes, more specifically, whether it was at all justified to sanction the applicant’s act. Indeed, the adjective “necessary” in Article 10 § 2 implies the existence of a pressing social need, and does not have the flexibility of such expressions as “useful”, “reasonable” or “desirable” (see, among other authorities, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24; The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 59, Series A no. 30; and Barthold v.

Russia, no. 38004/12, § 212, 17 July 2018).

Austria (no. 1), 23 May 1991, §\xa057\xa0in fine, Series A no. 204; Animal Defenders International, cited above, §\xa0100 in fine; and Murat Vural, cited above, §§ 44-53, with further references).&#39;,

The Court has had occasion to note that satire, by its inherent features of exaggeration and distortion of reality, aims to provoke and agitate. Accordingly, any interference with the use of this form of expression must be examined with particular care (see, among other authorities, Vereinigung Bildender Künstler v. Austria, no. 68354/01, § 33, 25 January 2007; Alves da Silva v. Portugal, no. 41665/07, § 27, 20 October 2009; and Eon, cited above, § 60), even though its use does not definitively rule out the possibility of restriction under Article 10 § 2 (see Leroy v. France, no.\xa036109/03, §§ 39 and 44, 2 October 2008, and Instytut Ekonomichnykh Reform, TOV v. Ukraine, no. 61561/08, § 46, 2 June 2016), or even of finding a complaint being inadmissible by reference to Article 17, in cases in which the satire is directed against the Convention’s underlying values (see M’Bala M’Bala v. France (dec.), no. 25239/13, §§ 31-33 and 39-42, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;52.\xa0\xa0It is true that Article 10 of the Convention does not bestow freedom of forum for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression (see Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, § 47, ECHR 2003-VI; Taranenko v. Russia, no. 19554/05, § 78, 15 May 2014; and Mariya Alekhina and Others, cited above, § 213). It is also true that in some cases the authorities may, consistently with that provision, limit the channels through which people and organisations can express themselves (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland [GC], no. 16354/06, §§ 57-77, ECHR 2012 (extracts), in relation to a refusal to allow a poster campaign on public spaces), even on matters of public interest (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, §§ 99-125, in relation to a general ban on paid political advertising on television). Indeed, the justification for such limitations can be even stronger when the “expression” at issue consists, wholly or in part, in conduct, as it did in the case at hand. In this case, however, the applicant was not prevented from approaching Mr Blagoev’s monument and placing the cap and the sack on it; he was later sanctioned for having done so. When an interference with the right to freedom of expression takes the form of a “penalty”, it inevitably calls for a detailed assessment of the specific conduct sought to be punished. It cannot normally be justified solely because the expression at issue was caught by a legal rule formulated in general terms (see, mutatis mutandis, Perinçek, cited above, § 275).&#39;,

Measures, including proportionate sanctions, designed to dissuade acts which can destroy them or damage their physical appearance may therefore be regarded as “necessary in a democratic society”, however legitimate the motives which may have inspired such acts.

He merely placed a cap on its head and a sack at its feet; those were removed by municipal workers a short while later (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). It was not suggested, either at domestic level or in the proceedings before the Court, that the applicant had somehow coordinated his actions with the unidentified people who had earlier painted Mr\xa0Blagoev’s statue in red and white and had painted the words “Father Frost” on its plinth (see paragraph 7 above).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;55.\xa0\xa0When it comes to such acts – which, though capable of profaning a monument, do not damage it – the question whether it can be “necessary in a democratic society” to impose sanctions in relation to them becomes more nuanced. In such situations, the precise nature of the act, the intention behind it, and the message sought to be conveyed by it cannot be matters of indifference. For instance, acts intended to criticise the government or its policies, or to call attention to the suffering of a disadvantaged group cannot be equated to acts calculated to offend the memory of the victims of a mass atrocity. The social significance of the monument in question, the values or ideas which it symbolises, and the degree of veneration that it enjoys in the respective community will also be important considerations.&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;56.\xa0\xa0In the present case, the context clearly suggests that the intention behind the applicant’s act was to protest against the government of the day and the political party which supported it, in the context of a prolonged nation-wide protest against that government, rather than to condemn Mr\xa0Blagoev’s historical role or to express contempt towards him (see paragraphs 4-11 above). The applicant simply used Mr Blagoev’s monument as a symbol of the political party that he wished to criticise. It can thus hardly be said that his act was meant to show disdain for deep-seated social values. This is further confirmed by the fact that it appears that the reactions to it were mixed (see paragraph 16 in fine above).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;57.\xa0\xa0It should also be noted in this connection that Mr Blagoev’s statue was put up during the communist regime in Bulgaria, and appears to have been seen as sufficiently connected to the values and ideas for which that regime stood to have been removed from its place, albeit for a few years only, shortly after the regime came to an end (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).

Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 83, ECHR\xa01999-III; Unabhängige Initiative Informationsvielfalt v. Austria, no.\xa028525/95, § 58, ECHR 2002-I; Krone Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Austria, no. 3138/04, § 32, 25 January 2007). But the Court is unable to follow the suggestion that the calculation of that loss should be based on the default statutory interest in Bulgaria; it is not bound by such domestic rules (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 83). The purpose of an award of pecuniary damages under Article 41 of the Convention is to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position in which he would have been if the breach of his rights had not occurred (restitutio in integrum). The interest rate applied by the Court, meant to compensate the loss of value of money over time, should hence reflect national economic conditions, such as the level of inflation and the rates of interest during the relevant period. Domestic rules on the calculation of default interest, which may reflect considerations going over and above restitutio in integrum, are thus not necessarily an appropriate measure; the Court must rather base itself on a rate of interest which best serves the purpose of its award (see Boyadzhieva and Gloria International Limited EOOD v.

In the light of these considerations and the available information about the economic conditions in Bulgaria during the relevant period, in this case it is reasonable to apply a rate equal to the base interest rate of the Bulgarian National Bank during the relevant period (which began when the applicant paid the fine and will end with the delivery of this judgment) plus one percentage point (ibid., § 55). This gives BGN 7.15 (equivalent to EUR\xa03.66). The global award in respect of pecuniary damage is thus BGN\xa0107.15, equivalent to EUR 54.66.&#39;,

     {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;It is easy to note that both cases relate to very similar situations, one that can be characterised as an “artistic performance pointing out social, economic and political issues” and the other one constituting purely “political protest”. Both applicants spent some time in prison – three months in the case of Ms Sinkova and 24 hours in the case of Mr Handzhiyski. It is worth noting that in the present case the applicant did not rely on Article 5 of the Convention. In Sinkova, the applicant was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, suspended for two years.

      &#39;elements&#39;: []},
     {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;Notwithstanding all the similarities, the majority reached a different conclusion in the present case. It seems that this conclusion is based on the considerations set forth in paragraphs 57-59 of the judgment, where it is stated that the statue of Mr Blagoev “was put up during the communist regime in Bulgaria” (similarly to the eternal flame monument in Sinkova) “and appears to have been seen as sufficiently connected to the values and ideas for which that regime stood”. It appears that the majority are of the opinion that anything that was put up during the communist regime and that can be identified with that regime is by default wrong and that it is acceptable to subject it to mockery. It should be noted that Mr Blagoev lived and died a long time (twenty years) before that regime came into power in Bulgaria. It could well be that in the context of Bulgaria’s political life this public figure is considered a part, or even a “founding father”, of the communist regime in Bulgaria. However, I am of the opinion that it would be difficult to objectively conclude that twenty years after his death, Mr\xa0Blagoev had anything to do with what that regime did – good or bad – during the communist era.&#39;,
      &#39;elements&#39;: []},
     {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;I have difficulty sharing that position, and without wishing to open a discussion on the values attached to statues and monuments in general, I feel bound to say that while we are not able to change history, we can properly evaluate it. We have witnessed many occasions on which historic monuments in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and so on, have been desecrated or completely destroyed for various reasons, but the motives were always a difference of opinion about the values these monuments represent. That behaviour is not acceptable. On the other hand, there are still monuments that glorify events, battles or persons promoting uncivilised actions or aims like slavery, or rulers who committed terrible atrocities during the colonial age, and so forth, but what makes a significant difference is the historical context of these events or personalities. What is acceptable to one person might be unacceptable to another, but one thing is certain – no one can change history and those events and personalities should be evaluated in their particular historical context.&#39;,
      &#39;elements&#39;: []},
     {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;In the context of this case, it was the duty of the authorities to protect those monuments that are in place today in so far as they are still there. It is up to them too to decide whether these monuments should still be left standing in public places, but in the meantime there is a necessity to act according to the law. In protecting them the authorities should also properly evaluate acts by individuals that publicly mock statues and monuments and what they represent, in the light of the “necessity in a democratic society”. In the instant case they did so by sentencing the applicant to a fine of\xa051\xa0euros, which is insignificant compared with the sentence imposed on Ms\xa0Sinkova, who spent three months in pre-trial detention as well as being sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, suspended for two years.&#39;,

However, the applicant was criminally prosecuted and convicted only on account of frying eggs over the Eternal Flame, which the domestic courts considered to amount to desecration of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, an offence under the Ukrainian Criminal Code. The charge against her concerned neither the subsequent distribution by her of the relevant video nor the content of the rather sarcastic and provocative text accompanying that video. In other words, the applicant was not convicted for expressing the views that she did or even for expressing them in strong language. Her conviction was a narrow one in respect of particular conduct in a particular place (compare Maguire v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 58060/13, 3\xa0March 2015). Moreover, it was based on a general prohibition of contempt for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier forming part of ordinary criminal law.&#39;,

     {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;By contrast, in the instant case, in paragraph 54 the majority turned its attention to the fact that the applicant had not engaged in any form of violence and had not physically impaired the monument in any way (the same was true of Ms Sinkova, who had merely fried eggs on the eternal flame). On that basis the majority concluded that this act of non-violent protest was “covered” by the principle of “necessity in a democratic society” and as such was justified. The message sent out is a dangerous one\xa0– whenever any desecration of monuments take place it will be justified as long as it is the result of non-violent protest that caused no damage to the statue or monument itself. This approval might easily undermine the principle of the rule of law and could be understood as an invitation to similar non-violent acts against any statue, monument or sacred places, acts that may well injure the feelings of those who support their existence. This is a potentially dangerous approval that is not consistent with the existing case-law of this Court.&#39;,

In particular, he had been unable to ascertain whether the interception authorisation had been issued by a competent court in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, whether it had been based on relevant and sufficient reasons or whether the requirements for judicial authorisation, such as the authorised duration of interception, had been complied with at the implementation stage.&#39;,

It had therefore not been included in the criminal case file and the defendant was not entitled to have access to it. The court further referred to the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 14 July 1998, holding that the person whose communications were to be intercepted was not entitled to participate in the authorisation proceedings or to be informed about the decision taken (see paragraph 50 below). The refusal to give the applicant a copy of the judicial authorisation had therefore been lawful.

          &#39;elements&#39;: [{&#39;content&#39;: &#39;79.\xa0\xa0The Government submitted that the applicants had not exhausted domestic remedies. Relying on the Constitutional Court’s Ruling of 14\xa0July 1998 (see paragraph 60 above), they submitted that a person who learned that he or she had been subjected to operational-search activities and believed that the actions of State officials  – including their refusal to grant access to information about the data collected – had violated his or her rights was entitled to complain to a court under section 5 of the OSAA (see paragraphs 58 and 59 above). As explained by the Plenary Supreme Court (see paragraph 66 above), such complaints were to be examined in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter 25 of the CCP and the Judicial Review Act.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;80.\xa0\xa0The Government further submitted that the fact that the person concerned did not possess a copy of the interception authorisation did not prevent him or her from lodging such a complaint, because the relevant court could request a copy of the interception authorisation from the competent authorities (they referred to the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 15 July 2008 concerning the possibility of applying for a supervisory review of the judicial decision authorising interception of communications, cited in paragraph 51 above). In any event, the proper procedure was to lodge a complaint under section 5 of the OSAA about the actions of State officials who had carried out the interception, rather than to appeal against the interception authorisation itself.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;81.\xa0\xa0The Government further submitted that instead of using the above effective remedy, Mr Zubkov and Mr Ippolitov (applications nos. 29431/05 and 7070/06) had chosen to raise the issue of covert surveillance in the criminal proceedings against them by contesting the admissibility of the audio and video recordings as evidence. The Government considered that contesting the admissibility of evidence in the framework of criminal proceedings could not be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of a complaint under Article 8. The aim of such a remedy was to exclude unlawfully obtained evidence from the list of evidence examined during the trial. It could therefore provide appropriate redress for a complaint under Article 6, but not for a complaint under Article 8. Indeed, the purpose of the criminal proceedings was to establish whether the defendant was innocent or guilty of the criminal charges levelled against him or her, rather than to attribute responsibility for the alleged violations of his or her right to respect for private life, home or correspondence. The remedy used by Mr Gorbunov (application no.\xa05402/07) had also been ineffective because he had appealed against the refusal to give him a copy of the judicial authorisation, rather than against the actions of the State officials who had intercepted his communications.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;82.\xa0\xa0The Government submitted in their further observations that Mr\xa0Gorbunov had moreover not complied with the six-month rule. The application form in which he had raised the complaint under Article 8 for the first time had been signed on 3\xa0October 2007, the last day of the sixmonth time-limit. There was, however, no evidence that it had been dispatched on that date. The postal receipt of 3 October 2007 produced by the applicant’s representative did not prove that it concerned precisely that application form. It could have concerned a letter sent by the representative to the Court in connection with another pending case. The Government therefore considered that the date on which the Court had received the application form should be taken as the date of introduction, with the consequence that the applicant had missed the six-month time-limit.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;83.\xa0\xa0The applicants submitted that the remedy suggested by the Government had been ineffective. Mr Zubkov and Mr Ippolitov argued that they had raised their complaints about unlawful covert surveillance in the criminal proceedings against them, both before the trial court and on appeal. They therefore considered that they had exhausted the domestic remedies.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;84.\xa0\xa0Mr Gorbunov submitted that he had complained to a court that both the refusal to give him a copy of the judicial authorisation and the interception itself had been unlawful. He conceded that his complaint about the unlawfulness of the interception had been sparsely reasoned. He had been unable, however, to advance more detailed arguments without knowing the contents of the judicial authorisation, that is without having any possibility of ascertaining whether the interception authorisation had been issued by a competent court in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, whether it had been based on relevant and sufficient reasons or whether the requirements of the judicial authorisation, for example the authorised duration of the interception, had been complied with at the implementation stage. The applicant further argued that he had preferred the procedure under Article 125 of the CCrP to the procedure under Chapter 25 of the CCP and that the Plenary Supreme Court had explained that it was the correct avenue in cases where criminal proceedings were pending (see paragraph 62 above). Given that his complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP had been rejected, a similar complaint under Chapter 25 of the CCP had no prospects of success.&#39;,

          &#39;elements&#39;: [{&#39;content&#39;: &#39;85.\xa0\xa0The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention  with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach, whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16\xa0September 1996, § 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;86.\xa0\xa0Under Article 35 an applicant should normally have recourse to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, §§\xa066 and 67).&#39;,

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 68).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;88.\xa0\xa0Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes at the outset that two of the applicants (Mr\xa0Zubkov and Mr\xa0Ippolitov) raised the issue of covert surveillance in the criminal proceedings against them. The Court has occasionally accepted that that remedy was apparently effective and sufficient and therefore the applicants who had pursued it complied with the exhaustion requirement (see Dragojević v. Croatia, no.\xa068955/11, §§ 35, 42, 47 and 72, 15 January 2015; Šantare and Labazņikovs v.\xa0Latvia, no. 34148/07, §§ 25 and 40-46, 31 March 2016; and Radzhab Magomedov v. Russia, no.\xa020933/08, §§ 20 and 77-79, 20\xa0December 2016, where the applicants had challenged the admissibility of the evidence obtained as a result of the allegedly unlawful covert surveillance measures in the criminal proceedings against them). On a closer examination, however, the Court has found that the courts in criminal proceedings were not capable of providing an effective remedy in the following situations: although they could consider questions of the fairness of admitting the evidence in the criminal proceedings, it was not open to them to deal with the substance of the Convention complaint that the interference with the applicants’ right to respect for their private life and correspondence was not “in accordance with the law” or not “necessary in a democratic society”; still less was it open to them to grant appropriate relief in connection with the complaint (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no.\xa035394/97, § 44, ECHR 2000V; P.G.\xa0and J.H. v.\xa0the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 86, ECHR 2001IX; Goranova-Karaeneva v.\xa0Bulgaria, no.\xa012739/05, § 59, 8 March 2011; and İrfan Güzel v. Turkey, no. 35285/08, §§\xa0106-07, 7 February 2017). This also applies to Russia. The Court therefore agrees with the Government that raising the issue of covert surveillance in the criminal proceedings cannot be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of a complaint under Article 8.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;89.\xa0\xa0The Court will next assess whether the applicants had at their disposal an effective remedy which they were required to exhaust before applying to the Court. It has already found that Russian law did not provide for an effective remedy against covert surveillance measures in cases where no criminal proceedings had been brought against the subject of the surveillance, in particular because the remedies invoked by the Government were available (a) only to persons who had at least minimum information about the judicial decision authorising interception of their communications, such as its date and the court which issued it (in the case of a supervisory review application); (b) only to participants to criminal proceedings while a pre-trial investigation was pending (a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP); or (c) due to the distribution of the burden of proof, only to persons who were in possession of information about the interception of their communications (a judicial review complaint under the Judicial Review Act, Chapter 25 of the CCP and the new Code of Administrative Procedure). It has, however, left open the question whether those remedies would be available and effective in cases where an individual learned about the interception of his or her communications in the course of criminal proceedings against him or her (see Roman Zakharov v.\xa0Russia [GC], no.\xa047143/06, §§ 294-98, ECHR 2015).&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;90.\xa0\xa0By contrast to the applicant in the Roman Zakharov case, the applicants in the present case learned about the interception of their communications in the course of criminal proceedings against them. The Court’s findings concerning the effectiveness of the remedies in the Roman Zakharov case are therefore not directly applicable to the present case. Indeed, the applicants were provided with some information about the surveillance measures taken against them, such as the period during which the surveillance had been carried out; or the dates and registration numbers of the relevant judicial authorisations and the courts that had issued them; or copies of the data collected. Arguably, that information could permit them to discharge the burden of proof to show that the surveillance had taken place and that their rights had thereby been breached, and to transfer the burden of proof to the authorities to show that it had been lawful (see paragraph 71 above).&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;91.\xa0\xa0That being said, it is significant that despite their requests, the applicants were not given copies of the judicial decisions authorising the covert surveillance measures and did not therefore know their contents. The Court considers that the non-communication of the factual and legal reasons for ordering covert surveillance measures must have undermined the applicants’ ability to exercise their right to bring legal proceedings in an effective manner. The Court will bear that in mind when assessing the effectiveness of remedies available under Russian law.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;92.\xa0\xa0The Government did not claim that the applicants should have appealed to a higher court against the judicial decisions authorising covert surveillance measures. Indeed, the OSAA does not provide for the possibility of lodging an appeal against such a decision, even after the individual concerned has come to know of its existence (see Avanesyan v.\xa0Russia, no.\xa041152/06, § 30, 18 September 2014). The Constitutional Court stated clearly that a surveillance subject had no right to participate in the authorisation proceedings, and therefore no right to appeal against the judicial decision authorising interception of his communications (see paragraph 50 above). At the same time, the Constitutional Court explained in 2008 – that is, after the facts of the present case – that a person who had been subjected to surveillance was entitled to apply for a supervisory review (see paragraph\xa051 above). The Court notes in this connection that, according to its constant practice, an application for a supervisory review in the context of criminal proceedings has so far not been considered as a remedy to be exhausted under Article 35 § 1 (see, among many others, Berdzenishvili v.\xa0Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, ECHR 2004II (extracts); Maayevy v. Russia, no. 7964/07, § 81, 24 May 2011; and Chumakov v.\xa0Russia, no. 41794/04, §\xa0125, 24 April 2012).&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;93.\xa0\xa0The Court further observes that section 5 of the OSAA provides that a surveillance subject may complain to a court about actions of State officials performing surveillance activities (see paragraphs 58 and 59 above). That provision, however, does not specify the procedure for the examination of such complaints. The Plenary Supreme Court later clarified that such complaints were to be examined under either Article 125 of the CCrP or the Judicial Review Act and Chapter 25 of the CCP. The procedure under Article 125 of the CCrP was to be used only while the criminal investigation was pending, that is until the criminal case was transmitted to a court for trial, whereas the procedure under the Judicial Review Act and Chapter 25 of the CCP was to be used in all other cases where a complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP was not possible (see paragraphs 62 and 66 above).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;94.\xa0\xa0The Court notes that the judicial review procedure under Article 125 of the CCrP was used by one of the applicants (Mr\xa0Gorbunov), but the Government claimed that it was ineffective and that all the applicants should have used the judicial review procedure under the Judicial Review Act and Chapter 25 of the CCP. Given the substitutability of the two procedures explained by the Plenary Supreme Court and their many common features, the Court will assess their effectiveness together.&#39;,

The review did not touch upon the legal and factual grounds for the underlying judicial authorisation, that is, whether there were relevant and sufficient reasons for authorising covert surveillance (see Avanesyan, cited above, §§\xa031-33, concerning an “inspection” of the applicant’s flat under the OSAA).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;96.\xa0\xa0Indeed, in accordance with Chapter 25 of the CCP and the Judicial Review Act, in force at the material time, the sole relevant issue before the domestic courts was whether the actions of the State officials performing covert surveillance were lawful (see paragraphs 72 to 73 above). It is clear from the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the relevant provisions that “lawfulness” was understood as compliance with the rules of competence, procedure and contents (see paragraph 70 above). It follows that the courts were not required by law to examine the issues of “necessity in a democratic society”, in particular whether the contested actions answered a pressing social need and were proportionate to any legitimate aims pursued, principles which lie at the heart of the Court’s analysis of complaints under Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 124 below).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;97.\xa0\xa0As regards the judicial review procedure under Article 125 of the CCrP, in addition to the issue of lawfulness, the domestic courts are also required to examine whether the State officials’ actions were “well\xa0reasoned” (“обоснованный”) (see paragraph 65 above). However, the domestic law does not provide for any substantive criteria for determining whether the actions were “well reasoned”. The term “well reasoned” commonly means no more than based on “valid” or “sound” reasons (see Lashmankin and Others v. Russia, nos. 57818/09 and 14 others, § 419, 7\xa0February 2017). There is no requirement that the actions be considered “necessary in a democratic society”, and therefore no requirement of any assessment of the proportionality of the measure. In any event, the Court is not convinced that a judge would have competence to review the “necessity” of the actions based on a valid judicial authorisation that had become res judicata.&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;98.\xa0\xa0The Court has already found on a number of occasions, in the context of Article 8, that a judicial review remedy incapable of examining whether the contested interference answered a pressing social need and was proportionate to the aims pursued could not be considered an effective remedy (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, §§\xa013539, ECHR 1999VI; Peck v. the United Kingdom, no.\xa044647/98, §§\xa0105-07, ECHR 2003I; and Keegan v. the United Kingdom, no.\xa028867/03, §§ 40-43, ECHR 2006X).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;99.\xa0\xa0In view of the above considerations, the Court finds that a judicial review complaint under section\xa05 of the OSAA – lodged in proceedings either under Article 125 of the CCrP or under the Judicial Review Act and Chapter 25 of the CCP – was not an effective remedy to be exhausted. It therefore dismisses the Government’s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;100.\xa0\xa0The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month rule is to promote security of law and to ensure that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with within a reasonable time. Furthermore, it ought to protect the authorities and other persons concerned from being under any uncertainty for a prolonged period of time. It marks out the temporal limits of supervision carried out by the Court and signals to both individuals and State authorities the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. The rule also affords the prospective applicant time to consider whether to lodge an application and, if so, to decide on the specific complaints and arguments to be raised. Lastly, the rule should ensure that it is possible to ascertain the facts of the case before that possibility fades away, making a fair examination of the question at issue next to impossible (see Sabri Güneş v. Turkey [GC], no. 27396/06, §§ 39-41, 29 June 2012).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;101.\xa0\xa0The requirements contained in Article 35 § 1 concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies and the six-month period are closely interrelated. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or after the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice toward the applicant. At the same time, Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, the Court considers that it may be appropriate, for the purposes of Article 35 § 1, to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Varnava and Others v.\xa0Turkey [GC], nos.\xa016064/90 and 8 others, § 157, ECHR 2009; El-Masri v.\xa0the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 136, ECHR 2012; and Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09 and\xa02 others, § 260, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). Also, if an extraordinary remedy is the only judicial remedy available to the applicant, the six-month time-limit may be calculated from the date of the decision given regarding that remedy (see Ahtinen v. Finland (dec.), no.\xa048907/99, 31 May 2005).&#39;,

Given that the Court has found that neither of those sets of proceedings constituted effective remedies within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, they cannot as a rule be taken into account for the purpose of the six-month rule.&#39;,

The Government did not claim that the applicants had any other effective remedies at their disposal. It follows that, in the absence of an effective remedy, the six-month period should as a rule have started to run when the applicants first learned about the covert surveillance being carried out against them.&#39;,

Russia, no. 4871/03, §§ 30-34, 22 December 2009; Artyomov v. Russia, no. 14146/02, §§ 109-18, 27 May 2010; Norkin v.\xa0Russia (dec.), no. 21056/11, 5 February 2013; Shishkov v.

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;106.\xa0\xa0The Court notes that this is the first time that it has undertaken an examination of remedies existing in the Russian legal system for complaints about covert surveillance of which the subject of that surveillance has learned in the course of the criminal proceedings against him or her. Given the uncertainty as to the effectiveness of those remedies – and in particular given that at the material time it could not have been presumed that raising the issue of covert surveillance in the criminal proceedings was a clearly ineffective remedy (see paragraph 88 above) – it was not unreasonable for the applicants to attempt to use an available remedy in order to give the domestic courts an opportunity to put matters right through the national legal system, thereby respecting the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see, for a similar reasoning, El-Masri, cited above, § 141).&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;107.\xa0\xa0Indeed, the applicants only learned about the covert surveillance during the criminal proceedings, when the prosecution used the intercepted material as evidence to substantiate the cases against them. The Court considers that it was reasonable, in such circumstances, for the applicants to try to bring their grievances to the attention of the domestic courts through the remedies provided by the criminal procedural law: by lodging a judicial review complaint under Article 125 of the CCrP or by raising the issue at the trial. The Court discerns nothing in the parties’ submissions to suggest that the applicants were aware, or should have become aware, of the futility of such a course of action. Indeed, the domestic courts could, and did, examine whether the surveillance measures had been lawful and therefore addressed, in substance, part of the applicants’ Convention complaints. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants cannot be reproached for their attempt to bring their grievances to the attention of the domestic courts through the remedies which they mistakenly considered effective (see, for a similar reasoning, Šantare and Labazņikovs, cited above, §§ 40-46, and Radzhab Magomedov, cited above, §§\xa077-79).&#39;,

This may prevent them from having a detailed understanding of the circumstances in which the surveillance had been carried out – such as the duration and dates of the surveillance, or the specific measures applied – and, most importantly, the grounds on which it had been ordered. It cannot therefore be regarded as unreasonable for an applicant to wait until he or she has received documents establishing the facts essential for an application to the Court before introducing such an application (see, mutatis mutandis, Younger v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.\xa057420/00, ECHR 2003-I).&#39;,

          &#39;elements&#39;: [{&#39;content&#39;: &#39;112.\xa0\xa0The Government submitted at the outset that the flat rented by Mr\xa0Zubkov (application no. 29431/05) could not be considered his “home” within the meaning of the Russian Constitution (see paragraph 42 above). Under Russian law only residential premises were considered to be a “home”, which enjoyed special protection. Other premises, such as business premises, were not regarded as “home” and did not therefore enjoy any special protection. The applicant had not been living in the flat in question; he had been living at another address. He had rented the flat with the sole purpose of using it for his criminal activities, in particular for storing and packaging drugs, meeting his accomplices, discussing their criminal plans and distributing the profits obtained through drug-dealing. Accordingly, Article 8 did not apply to the video surveillance of the flat in question. There had therefore been no interference with his right to respect for his home.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;113.\xa0\xa0The Government further submitted that the interception of the telephone communications of all three applicants and the video surveillance of the flat rented by Mr Zubkov had been carried out on the basis of proper judicial authorisations, in accordance with the procedure prescribed by domestic law.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;114.\xa0\xa0The judicial authorisations had not been included in the criminal case files because, pursuant to the OSAA, they were confidential documents. Relying on the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 14 July 1998 (see paragraph 50 above), the Government submitted that, because of the need to keep the surveillance measures secret, the person whose communications were to be intercepted was not entitled to participate in the authorisation proceedings, to be informed about the decision taken or to receive a copy of the interception authorisation. The Government also submitted that Mr\xa0Ippolitov had never asked for copies of the judicial authorisations in his case. He could not therefore claim that he had been refused access to them.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;115.\xa0\xa0The Government further argued that Russian law met the Convention “quality of law” requirements. All legal provisions governing covert surveillance had been officially published and were accessible to the public. Russian law clearly set out the nature of offences which might give rise to a covert surveillance order; a definition of the categories of people liable to have their telephones tapped; a limit on the duration of such surveillance; the procedure to be followed for examining, using and storing the data obtained; the precautions to be taken when communicating the data to other parties; and the circumstances in which recordings may or must be erased or destroyed.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;116.\xa0\xa0Lastly, the Government submitted that covert surveillance could only be carried out for the purposes specified in the OSAA (see section 44 above) and only on the basis of a court order. Those legal provisions guaranteed that covert surveillance, including that in the applicants’ cases, was ordered only when necessary in a democratic society.&#39;,

Despite that, the trial court had not examined whether such judicial authorisations existed. He further argued that at that stage of the proceedings, there had no longer been any need to maintain the confidentiality of the judicial authorisations, as the surveillance measures had been terminated. Moreover, they were no longer secret as the data collected had been disclosed at the trial. In support of his position he referred to Order no. 9407 of 17\xa0April 2007, which explicitly stated that judicial decisions authorising the interception of communications had to be sent to the investigating or prosecuting authorities together with the data collected (see paragraph 55 above). The failure to produce a copy of the interception authorisation either to the applicant or to the Court had made it impossible to verify whether the interception of the applicant’s telephone communications had been carried out in accordance with the procedure prescribed by domestic law.&#39;,

          &#39;elements&#39;: [{&#39;content&#39;: &#39;120.\xa0\xa0The Court accepts, and it is not disputed by the parties, that the measures aimed at the interception of the applicants’ telephone communications amounted to an interference with the exercise of their rights set out in Article\xa08 of the Convention. The Court reiterates in this connection that telephone conversations are covered by the notions of “private life” and “correspondence” within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 (see, among many other authorities, Dumitru Popescu v. Romania (no. 2), no.\xa071525/01, § 61, 26\xa0April 2007, with further references).&#39;,

The Court does not need to determine whether the flat in question was the applicant’s “home” within the meaning of that Article. It has already found on many occasions that a person’s private life may be concerned by measures effected outside his or her home. In that connection, the person’s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor. Private-life considerations may arise once any systematic or permanent record comes into existence, even if an audio or video recording is made while the person is in a public place (see Uzun v.\xa0Germany, no. 35623/05, §\xa044, ECHR 2010 (extracts), with further references). The Court finds that the covert video surveillance of the applicant while on private premises where his expectations of privacy were high, the recording of personal data, the examination of the tapes by third parties without the applicant’s knowledge or consent, and the use of the videotapes as evidence in the criminal proceedings amounted to an interference with the applicant’s “private life” within the meaning of Article\xa08 § 1 (compare Khan, cited above, § 25, and Vetter v. France, no.\xa059842/00, § 20, 31 May 2005, which both concerned recording, by means of a hidden listening device, of the applicant’s conversations with a third person on that person’s premises).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;122.\xa0\xa0The Court reiterates that such interference will give rise to a breach of Article\xa08 of the Convention unless it can be shown that it was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more legitimate aim or aims as defined in the second paragraph and was “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims (see, among other authorities, GoranovaKaraeneva, cited above, §\xa045).&#39;,

While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment in all these respects, the final evaluation of whether the interference is necessary remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention (see S. and Marper v.\xa0the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 101, ECHR\xa02008). In the context of covert surveillance, the assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the surveillance measures, the grounds for ordering them, the authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law. The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society” (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, §\xa0232).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;125.\xa0\xa0As regards the question of lawfulness, it has not been disputed by the parties that the covert surveillance of the applicants had a basis in domestic law, namely in the relevant provisions of the OSAA.&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;126.\xa0\xa0Although the applicants have not complained that the quality of the domestic law fell short of the Convention standards, the Court must, when examining whether the interference complained of was “in accordance with the law”, inevitably assess the quality of the relevant domestic law in relation to the requirements of the fundamental principle of the rule of law (see Dragojević, cited above,, § 86). The Court notes in this connection that in the case of Roman Zakharov v. Russia it has already found that Russian law does not meet the “quality of law” requirement because the legal provisions governing the interception of communications do not provide for adequate and effective guarantees against arbitrariness and the risk of abuse. They are therefore incapable of keeping the “interference” to what is “necessary in a democratic society” (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, §§\xa0302-04). In the present case, however, where the applicants’ complaints were based on specific and undisputed instances of covert surveillance, the Court’s assessment of the “quality of law”, although it necessarily entails some degree of abstraction, cannot be of the same level of generality as in cases such as Roman Zakharov, which concern general complaints about the law permitting covert surveillance and in which the Court must, of necessity and by way of exception to its normal approach, carry out a completely abstract assessment of such law. In cases arising from individual applications, the Court must as a rule focus its attention not on the law as such but on the manner in which it was applied to the applicant in the particular circumstances (see Goranova-Karaeneva, cited above, § 48).&#39;,

           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;127.\xa0\xa0In the Roman Zakharov case the Court has found, in particular, that the judicial authorisation procedures provided for by Russian law are not capable of ensuring that covert surveillance measures are not ordered haphazardly, irregularly or without due and proper consideration. In particular, the OSAA does not instruct judges ordering covert surveillance measures to verify the existence of a “reasonable suspicion” against the person concerned or to apply the “necessity” and “proportionality” tests. The Court has moreover found it established, on the basis of evidence submitted by the parties, that in their everyday practice the Russian courts do not verify whether there is a “reasonable suspicion” against the person concerned and do not apply the “necessity” and “proportionality” tests (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, §§ 260-67).&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;128.\xa0\xa0The Government did not produce any evidence to demonstrate that the Russian courts acted differently in the present case. In particular, they failed to submit copies of the surveillance authorisations in respect of the applicants and thereby made it impossible for the Court to verify whether the authorisations were based on a reasonable suspicion that the applicants had committed criminal offences. Nor could the Court verify whether the reasons adduced to justify the surveillance measures were “relevant” and “sufficient”, that is to say that the interception of the applicants’ communications was necessary in a democratic society and, in particular, proportionate to any legitimate aim pursued.&#39;,
            &#39;elements&#39;: []},
           {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;129.\xa0\xa0It is also significant that the applicants’ ability to challenge the legal and factual grounds for ordering surveillance measures against them was undermined by the refusal of access to the surveillance authorisations. The Court notes in this connection that there may be good reasons to keep a covert surveillance authorisation, or some parts of it, secret from its subject even after he or she has become aware of its existence. Indeed, a full disclosure of the authorisation may in some cases reveal the working methods and fields of operation of the police or intelligence services and even possibly to identify their agents (see, mutatis mutandis, Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 287). At the same time, the information contained in decisions authorising covert surveillance might be critical for the person’s ability to bring legal proceedings to challenge the legal and factual grounds for authorising covert surveillance (see Avanesyan, cited above, § 29). Accordingly, in the Court’s opinion, when dealing with a request for the disclosure of a covert surveillance authorisation, the domestic courts are required to ensure a proper balance of the interests of the surveillance subject and the public interests. The surveillance subject should be granted access to the documents in question, unless there are compelling concerns to prevent such a decision (see Radzhab Magomedov, cited above, § 82).&#39;,

There is no evidence that the domestic courts that examined the applicants’ complaints about the covert surveillance had access to the classified material in the applicants’ operational-search files and verified that the judicial authorisations to which the investigating authorities referred indeed existed and were part of the files, whether there had been relevant and sufficient reasons for authorising covert surveillance or whether the investigating authorities, while carrying out the surveillance, had complied with the terms of the judicial authorisations. The domestic courts did not, therefore, carry out an effective judicial review of the lawfulness and “necessity in a democratic society” of the contested surveillance measures and failed to furnish sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness within the meaning of Article\xa08\xa0§\xa02 of the Convention (see, for a similar reasoning, Šantare and Labazņikovs v.

In the event of failure to pay this sum within the said three-month period, the Government undertake to pay simple interest on it, from expiry of that period until settlement, at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.”&#39;,

In particular, Article\xa037\xa0§\xa01\xa0(c) enables the Court to strike an application out of its list of cases if “for any other reason established by the Court, it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the application”.&#39;,

To this end, the Court will examine carefully the declaration in the light of the principles established in its case-law, in particular, the Tahsin Acar judgment (see Tahsin Acar v.\xa0Turkey [GC], no.\xa026307/95, §§\xa075-77, ECHR 2003-VI).&#39;,

Russia, nos.\xa042525/07 and 60800/08, 10 January 2012). The complaint relating to the absence from a remand hearing is also based on well-established caselaw of the Court (see G.O. v.

As the Committee of Ministers remains competent to supervise, in accordance with Article 46 § 2 of the Convention, the implementation of judgments concerning the same issues, the Court is also satisfied that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention (Article 37 § 1 in fine) does not require it to continue the examination of this part of the case. In any event, the Court’s decision is without prejudice to any decision it might take to restore the application to its list of cases, pursuant to Article 37 § 2 of the Convention, should the Government fail to comply with the terms of their unilateral declaration (see Josipović v.\xa0Serbia (dec.), no.\xa018369/07, 4\xa0March 2008, and Aleksentseva and 28\xa0Others v.

Malta, no. 55263/00, §§ 44-45, 9 January 2003, where the Court considered that seventeen days to decide on the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention was excessive). It has already found a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention in a number of cases against Russia, where, for instance, the proceedings by which the lawfulness of applicants’ detention was decided lasted twenty-six (see Mamedova v.\xa0Russia, no.\xa07064/05, § 96, 1 June 2006), twenty (see Butusov v. Russia, no. 7923/04, §§\xa032-35, 22 December 2009) or twenty-seven days (see Pichugin v.\xa0Russia, no. 38623/03, §§ 154-56, 23 October 2012), stressing that their entire duration was attributable to the authorities.&#39;,

The Government did not provide any justification for the time it had taken the domestic courts to examine the appeal. There is nothing in the material before the Court to suggest that either the applicant or his counsel contributed to the length of the appeal proceedings. Accordingly, the entire length of the appeal proceedings in the present case was attributable to the authorities.&#39;,
          &#39;elements&#39;: []},
         {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;149.\xa0\xa0Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the appeal proceedings for the review of the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention pending trial cannot be considered compatible with the “speediness” requirement of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. There has therefore been a violation of that provision.&#39;,

       {&#39;content&#39;: &#39;152.\xa0\xa0The Government submitted that the commencement of the trial had been delayed at the request of counsel of one of the co-defendants to adjourn the trial, and again because of the illness of the applicant’s counsel. Without submitting any supporting documents, the Government further submitted that several hearings scheduled in September, October and November 2002 had been adjourned because the defendants’ counsel had failed to attend for various reasons. The delay in the commencement of the trial had not therefore been attributable to the authorities. After the commencement of the trial, several more hearings had been adjourned because counsel had been ill or had failed to attend for other reasons, because defendants had requested additional time to study the case file and prepare their defence, and once because a prosecution witness had not attended. The trial had also been adjourned for a year and three months in order that expert examinations could be carried out. The length of the proceedings had not, therefore, been excessive.&#39;,

<p>The field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">count</span></code> contains the number of hits in the database.
This is usually different from the number of items we requested.
If the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">count</span></code> is zero, we don’t have any results and need to check the URL and the parameters.</p>

<p>That looks good. Let’s fetch the list of cases, which are located in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results</span></code>:</p>

<p>Now we can inspect each case. Let’s loop over the cases and get some of the information.
The data contains various metadata about each case, such as the case name and the abbreviated case name.</p>

<p>It’s often useful to look at the data in a web browser to get an overview.
We can do that by opening the full URL, including the parameters:</p>
